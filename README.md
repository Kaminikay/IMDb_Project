# IMDb_Project
The dataset provided is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects.
The libraries for data analysis and visualization used in this project are
Numpy & Pandas.

A. Cleaning the data: This is one of the most important step to
perform before moving forward with the analysis. Use your
knowledge learned till now to do this. (Dropping columns,
removing null values, etc.)
Your task: Clean the data.

B. Movies with highest profit: Create a new column
called profit which contains the difference of the two
columns: gross and budget. Sort the column using

the profit column as reference. Plot profit (y-axis) vs budget (x-
axis) and observe the outliers using the appropriate chart type.

Your task: Find the movies with the highest profit?

C. Top 250: Create a new column IMDb_Top_250 and store the
top 250 movies with the highest IMDb Rating (corresponding to
the column: imdb_score). Also make sure that for all of these
movies, the num_voted_users is greater than 25,000. Also add
a Rank column containing the values 1 to 250 indicating the ranks
of the corresponding films.
Extract all the movies in the IMDb_Top_250 column which are
not in the English language and store them in a new column
named Top_Foreign_Lang_Film. You can use your own
imagination also!
Your task: Find IMDB Top 250

D.Best Directors: TGroup the column using the director_name column.
Find out the top 10 directors for whom the mean of imdb_score is
the highest and store them in a new column top10director. In case
of a tie in IMDb score between two directors, sort them
alphabetically.
Your task: Find the best directors.

E. Popular Genres: Perform this step using the knowledge gained
while performing previous steps.
Your task: Find popular genres

F. Charts: Create three new columns
namely, Meryl_Streep, Leo_Caprio, and Brad_Pitt which contain
the movies in which the actors: 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo
DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' are the lead actors. Use only
the actor_1_name column for extraction. Also, make sure that
you use the names 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad
Pitt' for the said extraction.
Approach and Tech Used

For this project I used Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda) to run my
queries and charts.
The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive
computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based
application suitable for capturing the whole computation process:
developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as
communicating the results. The Jupyter notebook combines two
components:
A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring
of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics,
computations and their rich media output.
Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in
the web application, including inputs and outputs of the
computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich
media representations of objects.

This project helped me in understanding the tables at a much-
detailed manner and helped to improve my strength in extracting

data from tables in a more efficient manner.
